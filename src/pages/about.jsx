                My name is Zachary Yuri Berunio, and I am currently studying BS Computer Science at Naga College Foundation. I have an interest in technology and its potential to use my skills in the near future.
              </p>
              <p className="card-text text-warning">
                I'm also a working student balancing my studies with a full-time job as a call center agent. Itâ€™s been a challenging situation, but a rewarding experience as I get to develop both my technical skills in school and my communication skills at work.
              </p>
              <p className="card-text text-warning">
                My ultimate career goal, aside from finishing my studies, is to have a profession/job that fits my basic skills.
